This is my Scheduling Application Console Demo which handles the following requirements:
1) Create persons with a name and unique email.

2) Create meetings involving one or more persons at a given time slot.

3) A meeting can only start at the hour mark and only last exactly one hour.

4) Show the schedule, i.e., the upcoming meetings, for a given person.

5) Suggest one or more available timeslots for meetings given a group of persons.

For the time format it is on PHT . Please follow this example format: yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss AM/PM

To compile the java files:
1. Go to the schedulingapp directory(cd schedulingapp)
2. Type in the console "javac *.java" then hit "Enter".
3. Then type "java Schedulingapp" to run the console demo.
